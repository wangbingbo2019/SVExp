### SVExp: Generating Synthetic Data with High-Order Gene Interaction Patterns

SVExp is a generator of Spatial transcriptomics data with spatially variable interactions (SVIs) of genes. It also provides a benchmark framework for analyzing SVI patterns detection tools, users can use our pre-generated data or generate their own synthetic data to perform validation.
